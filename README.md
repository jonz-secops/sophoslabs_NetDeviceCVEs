## Network Device Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Data
This repository contains information on published CVEs for network edge devices, as referenced in Sophos' "Pacific Rim" report.  To highlight the scale of worldwide threat activity, and as a potentially useful community resource, we have compiled a list of publicly documented CVEs affecting network (and other edge) devices offered by a selection of vendors. Where relevant public research exists, we have included details on active exploitation and suspected threat actors. This information has been compiled from publicly available sources and best-effort searches of publicly available information as of mid-October 2024, as noted in the table below:

Twenty-four vendors are represented in the data. This list is based on market share and general interest. Inclusion should not be interpreted as constituting any relation to the situations documented elsewhere in Pacific Rim coverage.
